Dr. Englert is a physician-scientist who cares for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit and studies the pathogenesis of ICU syndromes including ARDS and sepsis. He began his training at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.  While in medical school he was selected for a one-year Howard Hughes Medical Institute Fellowship that allowed him to work in the laboratory of Dr. Mitchell Fink studying mechanisms of organ dysfunction during sepsis. Following medical school, he completed Internal Medicine Residency Training at Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School. During that time, he worked with physician-scientists during clinical rotations in the ICU and witnessed how high-impact scientific research and evidence-based patient care can be integrated at the bedside. He went on to pursue Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellowship training in the Harvard Combined Program (Mass General/Brigham and Women’s/Beth Israel Deaconess). He completed his post-doctoral research training in the laboratories of Drs. Augustine Choi and Rebecca Baron at Brigham and Women’s Hospital where he obtained expertise in molecular biology, animal models of critical illness, and lung mechanobiology. In 2015 he joined the faculty at The OSU Wexner Medical Center and started his own independent laboratory.  His work has been funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Department of Defense, American Thoracic Society, and the Central Society for Clinical and Translational Research.  In addition to his laboratory research program, Dr. Englert has served as an investigator for over 30 ICU trials.  He is deeply committed to training the next generation of biomedical scientists and serves as the Associate Program Director for the OSU Pulmonary and Critical Care fellowship program.
