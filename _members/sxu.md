I am a graduate student in Pharmaceutics at the College of Pharmacy since 2022 and joined the  Englert lab in 2023. I graduated from University of Kentucky with a Bachelor of Science major in Biological Science in 2019. My research involves studying the role of mTORC1 activation in VILI models with an focus on nanoparticle drug delivery. When not in the lab, I like spending time with my bunny Bubble.
