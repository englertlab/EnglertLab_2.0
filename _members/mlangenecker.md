I am currently a research assistant in the Englert Lab. I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and will be starting an online Masters in Translational Pharmacology program in the Fall. The focus of my research is studying the effects of mTOR activation in mouse models of ventilator induced lung injury. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, and crocheting.
